## Merged Components

The following components were successfully merged from both repositories:

### From ChemLab 1 (Aspirin Synthesis):

- Base virtual lab framework
- Aspirin synthesis experiment data
- Core UI components

### From ChemLab 2 (Titration):

- pH meter simulation
- Titration trial tracking
- Enhanced results panel
- Chemical formulas component
- Acid-base reaction systems

### Enhanced for Both:

- ColorMixingSystem with reactions for both experiments
- ResultsPanel with comprehensive analysis
- Unified experiment data structure

## Development Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start

# Type checking
npm run check

# Database operations (if using)
npm run db:push
```

## Deployment Options

1. **Local Development:** `npm run dev`
2. **Production Build:** `npm run build && npm start`
3. **Docker:** Use included Dockerfile
4. **Cloud Platforms:** Supports Replit, Vercel, Railway, etc.

## Environment Setup

The application runs on **port 5000** and serves both the API and frontend through a single Express server with Vite integration in development mode.

No additional environment variables are required for basic functionality.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Dependencies:** Run `npm install` to ensure all packages are installed
2. **Port conflicts:** The app uses port 5000 - ensure it's available
3. **Node version:** Use Node.js 16+ for best compatibility
4. **TypeScript:** Run `npm run check` to verify types

## Support

This merged application combines the best features from both original ChemLab repositories, providing a comprehensive virtual chemistry laboratory experience with two distinct experiment types.
