# Aspirin Synthesis Virtual Chemistry Lab - Complete Package

## 🎯 Project Summary

I've successfully created a standalone aspirin synthesis virtual chemistry laboratory that can be easily integrated into your main webpage. Here's what has been delivered:

### ✅ What's Included

1. **Standalone React Component** (`aspirin-synthesis-standalone/`)
   - Complete self-contained virtual lab
   - Interactive drag-and-drop interface
   - Guided step-by-step synthesis process
   - Realistic chemical animations and heating effects
   - Progress tracking and completion celebration

2. **Simplified Main Project**
   - Removed acid-base titration experiment
   - Removed chemical equilibrium experiment
   - Updated to focus only on aspirin synthesis
   - Streamlined UI and interactions

### 🧪 Aspirin Synthesis Features

**Interactive Elements:**

- Drag and drop equipment (Erlenmeyer flask, thermometer, water bath, graduated cylinder)
- Add chemicals by dragging (salicylic acid, acetic anhydride, phosphoric acid, distilled water)
- Real-time heating simulation with temperature control
- Visual chemical mixing with color changes
- Bubbling animations during reactions
- Steam effects when heating

**Guided Learning:**

- 6-step guided procedure with visual indicators
- Current step highlighting and progress tracking
- Helpful hints and instructions for each step
- Automatic step progression based on actions
- Completion modal with celebration

**Educational Value:**

- Learn organic chemistry esterification reaction
- Understand catalyst use in synthesis
- Practice laboratory techniques virtually
- Safe environment for experimentation

cd aspirin-synthesis-standalone
npm install
npm run build
# Upload dist/ folder to your web server
```

**Option 2: React Component Integration**

```jsx
import AspirinSynthesis from "./AspirinSynthesis.jsx";

function MyChemistryPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>My Chemistry Course</h1>
      <AspirinSynthesis />
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Option 3: iframe Embed**

```html
<iframe
  src="./aspirin-lab/index.html"
  width="100%"
  height="800px"
  frameborder="0"
>
</iframe>
```

### 📋 Dependencies
